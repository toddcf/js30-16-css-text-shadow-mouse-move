# JavaScript 30 #16: CSS Text Shadow Mouse Move Event

Dynamically updates the text shadow style depending on where the mouse is on the page.

My own personal customizations:

- Dynamically calculate the shadow blur based on how far the mouse gets from the text.
- Dynamically calculate the shadow opacity based on the blur.
